## Auto Resize Controls in with Form Resize


</div>

### Description

When your form is resized, some of the controls contained there will be clipped (partially seen). This code tries to eliminate that by resizing all the controls in relation to the forms resized extent. The main routine will just have to be added at the FORM_RESIZE. Also supports MDI Forms. Enjoy!
